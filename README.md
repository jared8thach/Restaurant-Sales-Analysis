# Restaurant Sales Analysis

# Introduction and Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the daily sales and product sales history for an unnamed Vietnamese restaurant in the Inland Empire of California. We will recreate a POS dashboard which visualizes KPIs and metrics (such as daily/monthly sales, hourly sales heatmaps, and forecasting), suggest methods for reduction of menu itemization while minimizing profit loss, and suggest item price adjustments to increase profit. Also as an observational aside, we will determine whether or not tip amounts are statistically higher immediately after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Conclusion
As a final result of our sales analysis, we were able to successfully

- **Reduce menu size** by condensing appetizer choices which saw a
    - **12.5% increase in sales** for Egg Rolls
    - **4.96% increase in sales** for Chicken Skewers
- **Adjust pricing** for rice and salad dishes in which only the **Saigon Rice Plate** saw significant positive changes such as a
    - **$822.85 increase in sales**
    - **95 increase in quantity sold**
    
Also using **inferential statistics**, we were able to determine that **tip proportions are significantly (p < 0.001) higher** post-COVID pandemic than pre-COVID pandemic, as intuitively expected.
