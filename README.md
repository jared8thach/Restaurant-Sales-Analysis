# Restaurant Sales Analysis

# Introduction and Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze the daily sales and product sales history for an unnamed Vietnamese restaurant in the Inland Empire of California. We will determine whether or not tip amounts are statistically higher immediately after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest methods for reduction of menu itemization while minimizing profit loss, and suggest item price adjustments to increase profit.

# Methods Used
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Hypothesis Testing

# Technologies
Python and associated packages such as `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `SciPy`.
